# Classification of Objects using a Radar Signal and Machine Learning

This project was completed in the context of the `CS5014: Machine Learning` Module. The main aim of this assignment is to create a classification model while using real experimental and limited data that has not been analyzed before. There are two data sets corresponding to two tasks for this project: a binary classification task and a multiclass classification task. The following models were created for the purpose of this project:
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Linear Support Vector Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier

More information about the implementation and testing of the project can be found in the [report](Report.pdf).
